Key Features
---------------------------
*Graphical User Interface (GUI)*: The calculator features a clean and intuitive GUI, built using Java's Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT), which allows users to interact with the application through buttons and a display screen.
<br>
*Basic Arithmetic Operations*: The application supports the four fundamental arithmetic operations:
<br>
Addition `(+)`
<br>
Subtraction `(-)`
<br>
Multiplication `(×)`
<br>
Division `(÷)`
<br>

*Responsive Buttons*: All calculator buttons are interactive, providing immediate feedback when clicked, ensuring smooth user interaction.
<br>

*Error Handling*: The calculator includes basic error handling, such as preventing division by zero, and displays appropriate messages to guide the user.
<br>

*Enhanced UI Design*: The buttons are designed with a pale blue color scheme to improve aesthetics and make the interface more user-friendly.
<br>


Input Specifications
-----------------------------
*Number Input*: Users can input numbers by clicking the digit buttons (0-9) on the calculator interface.
<br>

*Operation Selection*: Users can choose an arithmetic operation by clicking the corresponding operation buttons (+, -, ×, ÷, %).
<br>

*Result Calculation*: After inputting the numbers and selecting the operation, users can press the '=' button to calculate and display the result on the screen.
<br>


Output 
--------------------------------
Result Display: The result of the calculation is displayed in the text field at the top of the calculator.
